Hello there! Let me tell a little bit about this new project I started: **The ES Podcast** ðŸŽ‰

This is my first attempt of starting a tech podcast, and it all started as an excuse to create a Gatsby Theme that use the datasource of Anchor. And to be more specific the project is this one that you are seeing right now! ðŸ˜„

Regarding the content of the podcast it will include:

- Opinion and learning that I think they are worthy to share with people.
- Recommendation of projects that I am making or that I found on the web.
- Interviews of some of my rockstar colleagues that are willing to participate in the project.
